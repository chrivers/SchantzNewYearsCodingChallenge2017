# Schantz' New Year's Coding Challenge 2017
This repo contains code related to [Schantz' New Year's Coding Challenge 2017](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/schantz-new-years-coding-challenge-2017-espen-højsgaard) on LinkedIn.


## Evaluation of solutions
To make scoring manageable, a script will be used to score submissions. We will up use the same Python3 script ([definitive_size.py](./definitive_size.py)) as last year. The script is a slight modification of a script kindly provided by Christian Iversen – thanks for letting us use it!

The Python3 script [compare.py](./compare.py) will be used to verify that the output produced by the submitted solutions matches the reference output [Santas-pension-projection.txt](./Santas-pension-projection.txt).
